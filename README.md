geetpractice
============

practice git flow

1. Fork repo to your own repo.
2. Clone to local machine.
3. Add upstream to AreYouARobot's geetpractice.
4. Make a feature branch to do work on.
5. Commit often! Prefix your commits? (e.g. (feat)).
6. Run git pull --rebase upstream master to pull down production master.
7. Check for conflicts if any and fix them, then push (git push origin <branch_name>).
8. (squash?) Make a pull request for your respective member to check and, hopefully, merge!
